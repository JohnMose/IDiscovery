Evaluation of Event Planner App 
 
The Event Planner App provides users with an easy-to-use interface to create, store, and manage their events. Overall, the app has several strengths, including its user-friendly interface, functional features, and efficient navigation. However, there are also areas for improvement in terms of human-computer interaction, security, maintainability, and screen size adaptability. 
 
Human-Computer Interaction: 
The app's user interface is straightforward, allowing users to easily navigate the app and create events. However, there is room for improvement in terms of interaction design, such as providing more feedback to users when they complete tasks or enter data. Additionally, there is a need for more graphical elements in the app's interface to enhance the user experience. 
 
Security: 
The app currently does not have any significant security features, which could make it vulnerable to hacking or data breaches. The user's personal and financial information, such as credit card details, may be at risk if the app's security is compromised. Therefore, adding secure login features, data encryption, and multi-factor authentication could enhance the app's security. 
 
Maintainability: 
The app's maintainability is essential for the app's long-term success. As the app continues to grow and expand its features, the codebase must be easy to maintain and update. Currently, the app's code is organized and structured well, but it could be further optimized to improve readability and maintainability. 
 
Ability to work with a range of screen sizes: 
The app's interface is designed to work on different screen sizes. However, the app could be improved by adding support for multiple screen resolutions and aspect ratios. This would ensure that the app is usable and accessible to a wider range of users. 
 
In conclusion, the Event Planner App provides users with a functional and user-friendly experience, but it could be improved in terms of interaction design, security, maintainability, and screen size adaptability. The app's strengths include its intuitive interface, useful features, and efficient navigation. However, to improve the app's overall usability, the developers must address the areas of improvement mentioned above.
